StreamPETR training pipeline using DALI.

This pipeline reads NuScenes samples in a sequence-based way, applies image decoding and augmentations,
filters and prepares both 2D and 3D ground-truth annotations, and converts outputs into the
training format expected by StreamPETR via a dedicated post-processing function.

.. seealso::

    Please also see :doc:`../2d_object_detection/pipeline_setup`. Here, we assume that the reader is familiar
    with that example and refer to it for some details which apply to both pipelines.

    '''Method used as a post-processing step to align data format to the format used in StrreamPETR training.

    The conversion includes the conversion to OpenMM data formats (where needed) and re-structuring of the
    data where the samples are combined into batches different than in the original collation implementation
    used in the PyTorch DataLoader data pipeline.

    Args:
        batch: DALI output batch. The can be either a :class:`dict` or a
            :class:`~accvlab.dali_pipeline_framework.pipeline.SampleDataGroup`, depending on whether the used
            :class:`~accvlab.dali_pipeline_framework.pipeline.DALIStructuredOutputIterator` was configured to
            convert the output to a dictionary or not.
        for_training: Whether the data is for training. Note that this parameter is not part of the
            convention for the post-processing function, and e.g. :func:`func_tools.partial` can be used to
            fix this parameter and remove it from the function signature.

        The converted batch. There are no restrictions on the format, but typically, this will be a
        :class:`dict`.
