This example consists of the following parts:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   pipeline_setup

   You can run the example using the script 
   ``packages/dali_pipeline_framework/examples/example_pipeline_obj_det_2d.py``.

.. important::

   Before running the example, you must prepare the NuScenes 2D image annotations by executing
   the script ``packages/dali_pipeline_framework/examples/prepare_dataset.py``. This generates the 
   ``image_annotations.json`` file expected by the 2D object detection pipeline.
