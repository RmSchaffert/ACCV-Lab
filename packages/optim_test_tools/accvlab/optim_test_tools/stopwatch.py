class Stopwatch(SingletonBase):
    """Stopwatch for performing runtime evaluations.

    This is a singleton class for performing runtime measurements and obtaining the total as well as average
    run-time for the measurements

      1. per measurement.
      2. per (training) iteration, where a single measurement can be performed multiple times, or only in some
         iterations.

    A warm-up phase can be defined when configuring the stopwatch. During the warm-up phase, no measurements
    are performed.

    Multiple measurements can be performed, and are distinguished by name. The end of a (training) iteration is
    indicated explicitly (by calling the method :meth:`finish_iter`). This is done to automatically start
    measurements after the warm-up phase is finished, to average the measurements over the iterations, and
    to print the measurements in certain intervals.

    The CPU usage can be measured for one "type" of measurement (i.e. one measurement name). This is done by
    calling the :meth:`set_cpu_usage_meas_name` before the first measurement with the corresponding name is
    started. The CPU usage is then measured whenever the measurement is running and the average CPU usage is
    printed together with the other measurements.

    One-time measurements can be performed at any point in the code (see :meth:`start_one_time_measurement`,
    :meth:`end_one_time_measurement`). They are not affected by the warm-up phase and are reported as such
    (i.e. in own section and without averages etc.). Each one-time measurement (i.e. measurement with a given
    name) can be performed only once.

    Warning:

        The CPU usage is measured using :func:`psutil.cpu_percent`. To ensure that the interval for which the
        CPU usage is measured is correct, the function :func:`psutil.cpu_percent` must not be called outside
        of the stopwatch during the measurement.

    The stopwatch must be first enabled before any measurements are performed. If not enabled, calls to any
    methods have minimal overhead. To ensure this, the methods are empty in disabled state and replaced with
    methods implementing the functionality when enabled. This means that the runtime overhead for using the
    stopwatch is negligible when it is not enabled. The enabling can be done from any part of the code (as
    this is a singleton).
