    Draws heatmaps for a batch of samples.

        heatmap: Tensor of shape (batch_size, height, width) when labels is None.
            Otherwise with shape (batch_size, max_num_classes, height, width).
            The heatmap will be modified in place.
        centers: RaggedBatch of shape (batch_size, max_num_targets, 2).
            The centers of the heatmaps to draw. `max_num_targets` is the maximum number of targets across the batch.
        radii: RaggedBatch of shape (batch_size, max_num_targets).
            The radii of the heatmaps to draw. `max_num_targets` is the maximum number of targets across the batch.
        diameter_to_sigma_factor: Factor for converting diameter to sigma.
        k_scale: Scale factor for the Gaussian kernel
        labels: RaggedBatch of shape (batch_size, max_num_targets).
            The labels are denoted as the class index. `max_num_targets` is the maximum number of targets across the batch.
            If None, all classes of the sample will be drawn in one heatmap.
