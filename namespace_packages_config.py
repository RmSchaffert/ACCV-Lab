Shared configuration for ACCV-Lab namespace packages.

# - Be a directory under the packages/ subdirectory
# - Have a pyproject.toml and setup.py file for building

# Please note that:
# - Packages that are not listed here will be ignored when installing all packages, building the
#   documentation, running the tests, etc.
