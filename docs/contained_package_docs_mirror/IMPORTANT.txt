This directory is a MIRROR of documentation content from the namespace packages.

- Purpose: Provide Sphinx with a unified view of each package's docs/ and any
  additional directories referenced by that documentation (e.g., examples/).
- Mode: The mirror is created by docs/mirror_referenced_dirs.py using symlinks
  by default (use --mode copy to copy files instead).
- Source of truth: Do NOT edit files here. Make changes in the respective
  package source directories under packages/<package_name>/...
- Build behavior: This directory is re-created on each documentation build.
- VCS policy: Everything in this directory is ignored by Git except this
  IMPORTANT.txt and .gitignore file.

Structure example:
- contained_package_docs_mirror/
  - <package_name>/
    - docs/                  # symlink to packages/<package_name>/docs/
    - <other_dirs>/          # symlinks to other referenced dirs (if any)

If the mirror appears stale or broken, rebuild the docs:
  cd docs && make html
